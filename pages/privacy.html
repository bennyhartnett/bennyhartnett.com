  <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
  <p>We collect and may collect the following categories of information:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Contact form submissions:</strong> When you use the contact form on
      the Site, your name, email address, and message content are transmitted to
      and processed by a third-party form service (Formly.email). We have no
      control over how that third party stores, processes, or retains your data
      beyond what is described in their own privacy policy.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Chat interactions:</strong> If you use the AI chat feature on the
      Site, your messages and conversation history are transmitted to third-party
      services (including Google Apps Script and AI model providers) for
      processing. Chat data may be logged, stored, or used by these third parties
      in accordance with their own policies. Do not submit sensitive, personal,
      or confidential information through the chat feature.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Analytics data:</strong> We use Google Analytics to collect
      information about your usage of the Site, including but not limited to page
      views, navigation paths, outbound link clicks, file downloads, form
      submission events, browser type, device information, operating system,
      referring URLs, session duration, and approximate geographic location. This
      data is processed by Google in accordance with Google's privacy policy.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Server and CDN logs:</strong> Our hosting infrastructure (including
      GitHub Pages and Cloudflare) may automatically log connection data such as
      IP addresses, request timestamps, browser user-agent strings, and requested
      URLs. These logs are controlled by the respective infrastructure providers
      and are subject to their privacy policies.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Local browser storage:</strong> The Site uses browser localStorage
      and sessionStorage to store user preferences (such as dark mode settings)
      and temporary routing data. This data remains on your device and is not
      transmitted to us.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Service worker cache:</strong> The Site uses a service worker that
      caches assets on your device for performance and offline access. This cache
      is stored locally on your device.

      voluntarily provide.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Any other data:</strong> Any additional information that you
      voluntarily submit through the Site, or that is automatically collected by
      cookies, tracking pixels, scripts, or similar technologies employed by us
      or our third-party service providers.
