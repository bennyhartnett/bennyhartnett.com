# BennyHartnett.com

This repository contains the source for Benny Hartnett's personal website. The main page presents a grid of icons that open various panels containing widgets such as email copying, a simple chatbot, project links, and search.

## Structure
- `index.html` – Landing page with icon grid
- `script.js` – Handles interactivity for showing panels, hover effects, and external redirects
- `style.css` – Styles for layout and animations
- `*.html` – Content for individual panels

## Development
Open `index.html` in a modern browser or use a lightweight static server. The site uses Bootstrap and Remix Icon CDN links, so an internet connection is required for full styling. The main page now includes basic SEO metadata for better discoverability.
