# Routes - you'll need to configure these in Cloudflare dashboard
# or use custom domains. The worker handles:
# - *.bennyhartnett.com (wildcard subdomains)
# - bennyhartnett.com/* (main domain paths)

# Uncomment and adjust if using routes:
# routes = [
#   { pattern = "bennyhartnett.com/*", zone_name = "bennyhartnett.com" },
#   { pattern = "*.bennyhartnett.com/*", zone_name = "bennyhartnett.com" }
# ]
